Combat is a major pillar of the gameplay for this game. It also represents a significant change in pace of the story and narrative. 
The goal behind combat segments of the game are to encourage teamwork and smart tactics to take down enemies, and stay healthy whilst you do that.

Combat begins when you encounter something that intends to do harm to you and which can't be resolved with a quick skill check.

At the beginning of the combat, both sides of the table will roll dice to see the turn order. This concept is known as an *"Initiative Roll."*
