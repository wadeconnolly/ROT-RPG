## Resolution

Era of Blight uses eight-sided dice. You roll several and read either the highest or lowest result after any modifiers.

- If the highest result is an 8 or above, it's a full success — things go your way. If more than 1 result scores above 8, it's a critical success — you gain additional benefits. 
- If the highest result is 5 - 7, it's a partial success — you achieve what you set out to do, but there is a consequence.
- If the highest result is a 1 - 4, it's a negative outcome — you likely fail and there are consequences. 

### A Pool of Dice?
To create a dice pool, you'll use an attribute (like Strength, Agility, or your Settlements development level) and take dice equal to it's ranking. You add or remove any extra dice as required for the roll. 

If you ever need to roll but have no dice for your pool, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You cannot roll a critical when you have no dice.

Some gear or abilities will grant a modifier to the roll. Typically they will apply a small bonus to the lowest rolled dice value, therefore hoping to increase your minimum skill level. Other such bonuses will be explicitly stated and may apply to your highest dice roll.
  
## Pillars of Gameplay

The two primary pillars of gameplay are *Combat and Exploration.* 
The *Social* aspect of the RPG is codified in mechanics, but you will find a very loose layout of rules for how it should interact. This is on purpose. At it's heart Era of Blight is two different games in one: *A narrative forward exploration game* with light social rules, and a *crunchy tactical combat game* with a resource management component.
