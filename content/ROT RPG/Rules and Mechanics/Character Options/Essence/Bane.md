At some point during, or before the game, your character has developed a vice, trouble or flaw that could hinder them at a moment's notice. Some examples could be:
- A fear of the dark.
- A sense of pride that blinds them.
- A rage that consumes them at a moments notice.
- An addiction to substances, or pleasures.
