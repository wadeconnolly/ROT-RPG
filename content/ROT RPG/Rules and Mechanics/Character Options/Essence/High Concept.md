As you think about your character, consider what makes them, well, them. Consider their background, skills and drive.
* A short list of examples are as follows:
* A knight, tainted by the abyss, seeking redemption.
- A lord, ruling a domain with her own law.
- A thief, exploiting the chaos for their own gain.
- A sorcerer, with nothing left, offering their power for coin.
- A loner, who always talks to his sword.

It isnâ€™t required to have a certain amount of depth, just something that you can pitch your character as on the spot. 

If you roll a check in which your High Concept is relevant, you can add an extra dice to the pool.
