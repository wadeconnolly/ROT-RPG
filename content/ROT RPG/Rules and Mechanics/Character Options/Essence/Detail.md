A character isn’t truly alive until they’re complete with extra Detail. Detail are elements to your character that make them just a little bit more unique compared to every other ‘Loner, who talks to their sword and is scared of the dark.’ Perhaps your character's detail is a trait, companion or some gear.

A good Detail consists of an element that can either be beneficial to your character, or may occasionally be a hindrance. It could be a “talking sword”, or even better, “a sword that doesn’t know when to stop talking.” 

- If your detail is gear, think about what makes it special. Is it stronger, faster, consumed by golden rot? Is it something we haven’t seen before in this world? 

- If your detail is a trait, think about what makes it unique. Is it physical, mental or emotional? Do you loom over crowds? Does your mind constantly work in highest gear? Are you driven by a strange or strong conviction? 

- If your detail is a companion, think about what or who it is and what they do for you. Do you have a hound that can fetch? A lizard who can scout and communicate with you? A sword that doesn’t stop talking?

With all types of Details, work with your GM to figure out some sort of benefit they provide you with, from bonuses to skills, to something else entirely. Remember, a good detail can and should be occasionally used against you to function as a Bane.
