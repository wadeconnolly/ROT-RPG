> Every player character in Blighted Age is a being of - or inflicted by - Rot who wanders the now dark and hostile world of Deossis. The Rot Bearers are adept at all of the various skills and abilities needed to survive and thrive in this harsh realm. Theyâ€™re all able to Fight in brutal combat, Sneak in the shadows, Sense the arcane forces, Influence others with their words, and so on.

When you create a character, you have several [[Character Options]] to consider.

First, it is good practise to come to the table with a character concept, or archetype in mind. This game refers to this as the narrative [[Essence]] of your characters. 
*Typically you are only required/asked to interact with the essence segment of the rules once per character during this character creation phase, but feel free to revisit and adjust your characters narrative essence from time to time as their narrative progresses.*

Second, consider your characters [[Attributes]]. Are you playing someone Strong or Wise? 
At character creation you have 30 "points" to allocate to your attributes, but cannot make any stat higher than 20 points. Yet.

Third, it's time to really make your character "great" at some [[Skills]]. Choose 3 skills you would like your character to be trained in. Raise their value from 0 to 1.
*If you would like to take a penalty to a skill, you may, you are permitted to reduce any skill from 0 to -1, and may then choose another skill to raise from 0 to 1.*

Fourth, it's time to equip your Rot Bearer with [[Gear]]. ((PLAYTEST)) At the start of your characters journey, they have enough funds and carry capacity to equip:
* 3 persistent consumables
* 5 weight worth of [[weapons]] or [[armour]]
You will find rules for both weapons and armour on their respective links, but a quick reference table can be found both here and on the
