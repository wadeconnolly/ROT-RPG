There is many different types of [[Items]] you can acquire throughout the land, but gear is your items.

Your "Gear" is composed of the [[Armour]] and clothes you wear, the [[Weapons]] you wield and any [[Consumables]] or [[Treasures]] in your bag and on your belts.

## Equip Load

Your adventurer can only **equip** so much gear before they exhaust all of their [[Stamina]]. 

Any equip-able set of armour or weaponry will typically have a listed weight value. If you find magical tools or other forms of [[treasures]] they may have a listed weight value too.
[[Consumables]] do not take any space as they can be stored in pouches, pockets and wherever your adventurer pleases really.

Gear weight in this regard is only relevant to the armour you're directly wearing and the gear you're specifically holding in your two hands.

### Gear Weight

This is a general rule of thumb regarding common gear weights:

| "Worn" Gear | Weight |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Robes       | 1      |
| Light       | 2      |
| Medium      | 3      |
| Heavy       | 4      |

| "Held" Gear      | Weight |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Light One Handed | 1      |
| Light Two Handed | 2      |
| Heavy One Handed | 3      |
| Heavy Two Handed | 4      |


## Carry Load

This game actively ignores codifying the ability to carry a finite amount of gear on your back/in your pockets. It simply doesn't matter, unless you need to wear it or hold it in your hands, gear doesn't have restrictions.
*Obviously this could be abused, so just be reasonable, discuss it at your table if you think it may be a problem.* 
*If you need a suggestion for a mechanic to codify it, consider limiting carry weight to your amount of stamina.*
