## Skill level 
There are several skills in the game that your characters use to overcome various challenges. You may be more familiar with the term ‘Skill Proficiency,’ this is akin to that concept.

Each skill has a level (from -3 — 3) that tells you how many points to adjust your lowest dice roll. Most beings that are attempting to perform a skill, like common PCs and Monsters, will typically have at least a basic skill level (0), but the values range from -3 to +3 to represent a particular disability or expertise.

In this system, the most common skills are listed below. 
*If you find your game might benefit from another skill, even temporarily, feel free to adjust the list, it may be good practise to reward bonuses based off of the character's essence in this regard.*
